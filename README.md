# Final Project
Edunet Internship final week assignment

hello !
I'm very glad that the model that I have made works pretty well and it's accuracy scores are good
Also I have learnt about streamlit and how to deploy my project in streamlit and it's quite interesting 
A special thanks for the Mentor of this Project
